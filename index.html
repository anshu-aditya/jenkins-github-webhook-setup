        Demo of Webhook Setup between GitHub and Jenkins
    </h1>

    <p>
        To illustrate the process of setting up a webhook integration between GitHub and Jenkins, 
        begin by ensuring that Jenkins is accessible via a public URL, 
        which can be achieved using tools like ngrok or by hosting Jenkins on a server with a public IP. 
        In Jenkins, create a new freestyle project or pipeline and configure it to trigger builds using the "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" option. 
        Next, navigate to your GitHub repository, go to Settings â†’ Webhooks, and click on "Add webhook".
